# SmartSupport 🎓🛠️

SmartSupport is a **Django-based web application** designed to simplify the process of reporting and managing campus maintenance issues. Students can raise tickets (e.g., broken fan, damaged bench), and admins can verify, update, and resolve them efficiently.

- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Tickets move through statuses: *Pending → Accepted → Resolved*.  
- 🔐 **Login System**: Separate login for Admin and Student.  
- 📷 **Image Upload**: Students can upload photos to provide better issue context.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
